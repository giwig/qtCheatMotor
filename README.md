I want to make a small analogue for CheatEngine in python.
It may even be possible to make it cross-platform.

Pros and cons in CheatEngine:

Pro:
- written in Delphi, which complicates development
- it is difficult and long to carry out tests with every change.
- Not everyone knows the Delphi language anymore.

Cons:
+ large community
+ a lot of functionality in the program

TODO:
- Make a process library.
- Make a visual list of processes.
- Create a library for searching numbers.
  - byte
  - word
  - dword
  - qword
  - float
  - double
  - string (char, wchar)
  - array of bytes
- Create a library for disassembly code (x86, x64)
