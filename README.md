# qtCheatMotor

qtCheatMotor - this is my little python project.


I want to make a small analogue for CheatEngine in python.
It may even be possible to make it cross-platform.

Pros and cons in CheatEngine:

Pro:
- written in Delphi, which complicates development
- it is difficult and long to carry out tests with every change.

Cons:
+ large community
+ a lot of functionality in the program
